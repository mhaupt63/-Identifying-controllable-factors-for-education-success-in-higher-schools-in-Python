# -Identifying-controllable-factors-for-education-success-in-higher-schools-in-Python
A project I did for the eDX subject "Python for Data Science'

I did an analysis of multi-year data in the Massachussetts public school system to indentify what factors educators should focus on.  The data was in Kaggle and I provided the code as a kernel here.
